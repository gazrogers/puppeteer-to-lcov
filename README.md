# Puppeteer to LCOV

After a lot of frustration trying to make CodeceptJS, Puppeteer, puppeteer-to-istanbul, and the NYC reporting tool work
together in a way that makes sense, I've finally got fed up and I'm looking at the direct translation of the coverage
data.

This is a work in progress and may well come to nothing (like everything else in this wasteland of a repository), so
you probably shouldn't bother to watch it too closely.

If it ever goes somewhere useful, I'll clean it up and update this ReadMe.
